- 👋 Hi, I’m @shawncarlson
- 👀 I’m interested in staying current with github functionality from a highlevel Program Management perspectiove. For the last 10+ years every team I have lead uses github to an greater or lessor extent. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure Cloud and how to adhear to the no code in the cloud initiative the company I am contracting with has. Addtionally, like right now, I am digging into the topic of 'how to copy data to and from an on-premises file system by using Azure Data Factory.'
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Agile is what my career path has been tied to since 1999, regardless of my role.
- 📫 How to reach me is not an easy question to answer at present. My email account(s) are rather saturated. I guess the least crazy one is shawncal@live.com or just message me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawncarl/ telling me to check my messages. lol
